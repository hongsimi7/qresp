"""Deterministic relatedness scoring for Related Research.

This module is PURE: no database, no network, no clock, no environment, no
language model. It takes plain dictionaries in and returns evidence out, so
every threshold below is unit-testable in isolation (see
`tests/test_relatedness.py`).

Why it exists
-------------
"Semantic Scholar returned it" and "same journal, same year" are not reasons.
A recommendation is only shown when Qresp can NAME the overlap it found in the
two records' own scientific metadata. Everything the user reads under
"Why related" is generated here, from the evidence that actually fired -- no
sentence is written by a model, and no DOI, paper title or material name is
hardcoded anywhere in this file.

The gate
--------
A candidate is shown only if it has

  * at least one STRONG piece of evidence, or
  * at least two MEDIUM pieces of evidence from INDEPENDENT families.

"Independent" means different signal families (terms / text / methods /
citation): two mediums derived from the same overlap are one observation, not
two. Every one of those families is about SUBJECT MATTER. At most
MAX_RESULTS (3) are shown, and the list is never padded to reach it.

Deliberately NOT read at all
----------------------------
AUTHORS and COLLECTIONS. They are metadata a record carries and a reader is
shown; they take no part in the gate, the score, the reasons, the order or
the tie-break, and `build_internal_profile` does not read `collections` at
all. Removing every author from both records, or replacing them with
strangers, cannot change which candidates come back or the order they come in
-- `tests/test_relatedness_neutrality.py` asserts exactly that. Authors
survive on the Profile for ONE purpose: `related._result` renders them beside
the recommendation.

Deliberately NOT evidence, alone or together
--------------------------------------------
Same journal, adjacent publication years, a single broad field, generic words
("study", "data", "analysis", "simulation"), and the provider's own ranking.
None of them produce an Evidence object at all, so none of them can push a
candidate through the gate.

Specificity comes from the Qresp corpus itself: a term that appears in a large
share of the corpus is a field label, not a fingerprint, and is weighted (and
gated) accordingly.
