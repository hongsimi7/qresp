"""Per-candidate evidence for the RCC folder-candidate AI.

Why this exists
---------------
The folder analysis already reads a bounded set of text files off the file
server, but only Tool candidates ever looked at them: a Dataset's own
README, a Script's module docstring and a Chart notebook's markdown were
fetched (or, for notebooks, not even fetched) and then thrown away. The AI
action therefore received the candidate's NAME, its RELATIVE PATHS and the
analyzer's own structural sentences -- and, from the browser, whatever the
curator had already typed into the same field it was being asked to fill.

This module turns the inventory plus that bounded text into a STRUCTURED,
per-candidate evidence bundle:

    {"type": "readme", "path": "scripts/a/README.md", "excerpt": "..."}
    {"type": "docstring", "path": "scripts/a/run.py", "excerpt": "..."}
    {"type": "python_symbols", "path": "scripts/a/run.py",
     "names": ["load_data", "plot_band_structure"]}

Hard rules, all enforced here rather than trusted to a prompt:

* Evidence NEVER crosses a candidate boundary. A source is admitted only when
  its path is inside the candidate's own boundary, so a sibling dataset's
  README can never describe this one.
* Raw data content is never read. No CSV/JSON/HDF5 values, no image bytes, no
  notebook code cells, outputs or attachments, no function bodies, no string
  literals -- only top-level `def`/`class` NAMES, via `ast`, and only when the
  file actually parses.
* Everything is untrusted text. Credential-shaped values are redacted before
  the bundle is built, and every excerpt is length-capped.
* Budgets are explicit and deterministic: per source, per candidate, and per
  candidate file count.

Nothing here fetches, writes, renames or stores anything. It is a pure
function of the inventory and the text the caller already has.
