"""Workflow graph validation.

A paper's workflow says how inputs and software produced a figure. It is
OPTIONAL: a record with no workflow, or with the untyped `[from, to]` edges
every record written before this module used, is valid and is left alone.

WHAT AN EDGE MEANS
==================
V1 gives edges a semantic type, so a graph states a relationship rather than
just a line between two boxes:

TWO CLASSES OF EDGE
===================
They answer different questions and are validated differently.

DIRECTED (provenance): what produced what.

    consumes    Dataset or External Data  ->  Script or Chart
    uses_tool   Tool                      ->  Script
    generates   Script                    ->  Chart
    feeds_into  any kind                  ->  the SAME kind

These describe a flow, so they read one way only.

A CYCLE AMONG THEM IS ACCEPTED, because refinement is real: fit, adjust, fit
again. It is not accepted quietly -- the Curator asks before drawing one and
then shows it as a FEEDBACK LOOP, marked differently from ordinary flow, so a
reader can tell a deliberate loop from a mistake. Storage's job is to keep
what the curator confirmed, so this module no longer refuses it.

What is still refused is an artifact joined to ITSELF, which has no reading at
all, and every endpoint rule above.

UNDIRECTED (association): these two belong together.

    related_to  any kind                  <-> the SAME kind

`related_to` states no order and no data flow. Two figures showing the same
system, two datasets from one run, two tools that go together -- a curator can
say they are related without claiming one produced the other. It joins ONLY
two artifacts of the same kind, because a relationship across kinds already
has a directed name and offering a vaguer second one would let the same fact
be recorded two ways.

Because it asserts no direction, it takes no part in the cycle check. What it
does refuse is an artifact related to itself, and the same pair recorded twice
-- in either order, since `a related_to b` and `b related_to a` are one fact.

An edge with no type is a LEGACY edge. It is accepted and preserved exactly as
stored; nothing here rewrites one, because guessing what an old curator meant
is not this module's business.

WHAT IS REFUSED
===============
Only things that are wrong however you read them:

  * an edge from a node to itself;
  * an edge naming an artifact this paper does not have (which is also how a
    cross-paper reference presents -- another paper's ids are simply not in
    this paper's artifact list);
  * a cycle, which would claim a figure helped produce itself;
  * a typed edge whose endpoints cannot hold that relationship.

WHEN IT RUNS
============
Only when the caller actually submits a workflow. A metadata edit that does
not mention one must not be refused because a record written years ago holds
an edge this module would not accept today -- that would make legacy papers
uneditable, which is a worse outcome than an old graph staying as it is.
