"""Related Research domain-quality evaluation — a read-only QA command line.

    python -m project.tools.related_eval collect   --api-base URL ...
    python -m project.tools.related_eval summarize --output-dir DIR

WHY this exists
---------------
The quality gate was calibrated by reasoning, and the one thing nobody has
measured is whether it agrees with a physicist. Its own accept/reject decision
therefore cannot be the answer key. This tool lays the gate's verdicts out
next to the candidates it threw away, so a person can rate them and the gate
can be judged against those ratings -- including the failure that matters
most, a genuinely related paper the gate rejected.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
* It never writes to Qresp: no Paper, no Draft, no cache, no MongoDB. It
  speaks only to the public read APIs (`/api/search`, `/api/paper/{id}`).
* It never calls `/api/paper/{id}/related`, so the production cache and the
  provider quota behind it are untouched.
* It performs NO external network request unless `--live` is given.
* It never fills a human rating in. `human_rating` is written empty and only
  a person may change it; every metric excludes unrated rows and reports how
  many there were.
* It writes only into the output directory it is given, and never touches an
  earlier `related-eval-*` run, a human review sheet, the production cache,
  or MongoDB.
* It never emits curator identity, owner/editor fields, RCC URLs, file-server
  paths, file or image names, the API key, or any request header. The
  allowlist that guarantees this is `eval_core.to_canonical_record` and
  `eval_core.CANDIDATE_KEYS`.

Related External Papers, as displayed
-------------------------------------
Production asks the provider for `related.EXTERNAL_CANDIDATE_LIMIT` (150)
candidates and shows at most `related.EXTERNAL_MAX_RESULTS` (25) of the ones
that clear the gate, five to a page over five pages. This tool models that
exactly: every candidate carries `display_rank` (1-25), `display_page` (1-5)
and `visible`, so "the gate accepted it" is never confused with "a reader
sees it". `external-review.tsv` is the BLIND sheet -- every visible page-1
result, a deterministic stratified sample of pages 2-5, and a deterministic
stratified sample of candidates the gate REJECTED, with no gate score,
verdict, reason, rank or page number in it and the rows ordered by an opaque
`pair_id` so position leaks nothing either.

The rejected sample is what makes a false negative findable. Every visible
candidate passed the gate, so a sheet built only from visible ones can only
ever report zero false negatives -- and that zero is indistinguishable from a
measured one. `summarize` reports the sampled denominator alongside the
count, and reports `available: false` rather than `0` when no rejected
candidate has been rated.

Precision is measured over the UNIQUE VISIBLE CANDIDATES in
`raw-results.jsonl`, never over review rows: a candidate can appear in more
than one sheet, and how many sheets somebody was handed must not move a
number. Ratings are collapsed per candidate first, and two different ratings
for one candidate stop the run instead of one being picked.

The scoring is not reimplemented. Candidate fetching comes from
`project.related`, profiles and the gate from `project.relatedness`.
