"""Benchmarks for Qresp's two AI assist features — read-only, offline QA.

    .\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m project.tools.assist_eval <command>

    collect      --api-base URL --output-dir DIR [--execute]
    collect-rcc  --output-dir DIR [--execute] [--limit N]
    audit        --output-dir DIR
    smoke-sample --output-dir DIR [--seed N]
    run          --output-dir DIR [--execute]
    summarize    --output-dir DIR

Every network step is a dry run until `--execute` is given: `collect` reads
a live Qresp instance, `collect-rcc` reads a live file server, and `run` is
the only one that reaches Gemini.

WHAT IS MEASURED
----------------
1. **Paper keywords** (`POST /api/assist/keywords`). A record's own `tags` are
   hidden, the keyword AI is run on the same inputs the product allows, and
   the suggestions are compared with the hidden tags -- in two modes,
   publication-only and publication-plus-artifacts.
2. **RCC artifact descriptions** (`POST /api/curation/describe-candidates`).
   An RCC candidate is paired with the human-authored artifact for the SAME
   file, the human text is hidden, and the description AI sees only what the
   product would send it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
----------------
The existing curation is a **reference**, not ground truth. A curator's tag
is one defensible choice among several, and a suggestion that misses it is
not thereby wrong. Exact string matching cannot see that "DFT" and "density
functional theory" are one answer, so every exact score here is a LOWER
BOUND and is labelled as one.

The judgement is also **AI-based provisional evaluation**: where a model
scores its own output the bias is toward itself, and the summaries say so.
Nothing here changes a prompt, a threshold, a quota or any served behaviour.

SAFETY
------
* No provider call without `--execute`. `collect` and `smoke-sample` never
  call one at all, and `summarize` re-aggregates cached answers only.
* Qresp is read through its public read APIs; RCC analyses are read from
  files the curator already saved, so no file server is contacted.
* MongoDB, drafts, published records, the serving cache and the per-user
  quota counter are never written.
* The API key is read from the environment only, and is reported as a
  boolean. Keys, headers, prompts and payload bodies never reach stdout.
