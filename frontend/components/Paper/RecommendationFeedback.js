// "Were these recommendations helpful?" — the one measurement of this feature

//
// Everything else Qresp knows about the recommendation list is either
// arithmetic the quality gate did to itself or a domain expert rating a
// spreadsheet offline. This is a reader, on a real record, looking at the
// real list.
//
// SIGNED IN ONLY, and that is a reversal of how this first shipped. Anonymous
// rating was keyed by a per-session token, so a respondent could mint a new
// identity by clearing a cookie: "one opinion per reader" was not true, and
// one person with a browser could move the average. Readers without an
// account now get a sign-in prompt instead of a scale, and their opinion is
// not collected.
//
// It renders only when there ARE results AND the backend issued a signed
// `feedback_context` for them. Asking "were these helpful?" under an empty
// list asks about nothing; without a context there is nothing the server can
// verify the answer against, and a rating it cannot verify is one it will
// refuse anyway.
