/**
 * The order of the curator's sections.
 *
 * This reads the page source rather than mounting it. Rendering /curator
 * needs auth, a router, the file tree, every artifact form and a live draft;
 * none of that is what this asserts. The claim is about ORDER, the order
 * lives in one JSX block, and a source read catches the accidental reorder
 * that a heavier test would too, without the machinery.
